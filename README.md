# Mapping-Houston-Real-Estate-Data-using-Python-and-Basemap-Zillow-Data-
In this notebook I am going to use real estate historical price data downloaded from Zillow to visualize changes in single family residences within Houston area. 

The data required for this notebook are:
* Zip_Zhvi_SingleFamilyResidence.csv: Single family residence price data downloaded from Zillow data research. This file is downloaded from [Zillow Data Research](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). **Since this file is larger than 25 MB. You can download this file and run it on your own machine.**
* Zip_Codes shape file that contains zip codes from greater Houston area. This file is used to plot zip codes maps using Matplotlib and Basemap. This file is downloaded from [City of Houston Open Data Website](https://cohgis-mycity.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/zip-codes)
* cities_population_data.csv: US Census population data. This file used to compare Huston Population to other crities in US. This file is downloaded from [US Cenus Website](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html)

Hope you enjoy it!
